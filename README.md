ImageShare is a solo project I had to build during my training at BeCode. The goal was to deploy some sort of Pinterest clone made totally with Laravel. 
You can see it deployed on [Heroku](https://pin-tes-restes.herokuapp.com/).

### Features

- Authentication system 
- Register system 
- Profile page (still to be done)
- CRUD
- Homepage with tiles
- Redirection on click with details of the photo (still to be done)
- Deploy the app & db (halfway through)

Work in progress...
